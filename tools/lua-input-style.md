# StyLua

We currently use [StyLua](https://github.com/JohnnyMorganz/StyLua) to format our `lua` input files. 

The OpenSn StyLua configuration file is named `.stylua.toml` and can be found in the top-most OpenSn directory. 

Basic usage information is:
```
stylua -f PATH_TO_STYLE_FILE/.stylua.toml PATH_TO_INPUT_FILE/input_file.lua
```

More usage information for StyLua can be found [here](https://github.com/JohnnyMorganz/StyLua?tab=readme-ov-file#usage).
