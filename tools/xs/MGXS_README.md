# Multigroup Cross-Section Generation Using OpenMC

We provide a few Jupyter notebooks showcasing the generation of multigroup cross-section (MGXS) libraries using [OpenMC](https://docs.openmc.org/en/stable/index.html). 

The MGXS are stored in **h5 format**, which is directly readable by OpenSn.

1.  [create_openmc_xslib.ipynb](create_openmc_xslib.ipynb): generation of MGXS for a homogeneous domain
2.  [pincell_mgxs_openmc.ipynb](pincell_mgxs_openmc.ipynb): generation of MGXS for a PWR pin cell (UOx fuel, gap, clad, water)
3.  [CASL_2B.ipynb](CASL_2B.ipynb): generation of MGXS for the CASL 2B benchmark
