Introduction to Angular Quadratures
===================================

OpenSn is a discrete-ordinates code, relying on the use of angular quadratures.

Several choices are possible:
- A Product Quadrature set (using Gauss-Legendre quadrature along the polar angle, and a Gauss-Chebyshev quadrature along the azimuthal angle)
- A Triangular Quadrature set (using Gauss-Legendre quadrature along the polar angle, and a Gauss-Chebyshev quadrature along the azimuthal angle)
- A Linear Discontinuous Finite Element (LDFE) Quadrature set that allows for local angular refinement
